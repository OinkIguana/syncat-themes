# Syncat Themes

Themes for [Syncat][] syntax aware cat tool. See the Syncat documentation for more information on
how to install and use Syncat.

Note that depending on your terminal settings, certain features of some themes may not appear as 
you expect them to.

## Creating themes

Syncat supports the `--dev` option, which instead of just printing the contents of the file, will
print the parsed source code as an s-expression including every token. You can use the names of each
node in a stylesheet, as in this repo.

The themes are specified in `.syncat` files, using a syntax similar to CSS.
